			<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Sir,</p>
			<p>I have the honour to inform you, your late affair with <abbr>M.</abbr> the Viscount de Valmont was this morning much talked of among the King’s counsel within the bar, and that it is much to be feared the public officers will commence a prosecution. I thought this notice might be of service, either to set your friends at work, to stop the bad consequences, or, in case you could not succeed, to take every precaution for your personal security.</p>
			<p>If you would permit me to add a piece of advice, I think you would do well, for some time at least, not to appear so much in public as you have done for some days⁠—Although the world generally have great indulgence for those kind of affairs, yet there is a respect due to the laws which ought to be observed.</p>
			<p>This precaution appears to me the more necessary, that I recollect a Madame de Rosemonde, who, I am told, is <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont’s aunt, intended to prosecute you; if so, the courts could not refuse her petition: it would perhaps be proper application should be made to this lady.</p>
			<p>Particular reasons prevent me from signing this letter; but I hope, though ignorant from whom it comes, you will nevertheless do justice to the sentiment that has dictated it.</p>
