			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>There are, my dear and worthy friend, the strangest and most sad reports spread here, on account of Madam de Merteuil. I am certainly far from giving any credit to them; and I would venture to lay a wager, they are horrible slanders; but I know too well, how the most improbable wickedness readily gains credit; and how difficult it is to wipe away the impression they leave, not to be alarmed at those, though I think them so easy to be refuted. I wish, especially, they might be stopped in time, and before they spread abroad; but I did not know until late yesterday, the horrible things that are given out; and when I sent this morning to Madame de Merteuil’s, she was just then set out for the country for a couple of days⁠—I could not learn where she was gone; her second woman, who I sent for, told me, her mistress had only given her orders to expect her on Thursday next; and none of her servants she left behind her knew any thing. I cannot even think where she can be; as I do not recollect any of her acquaintance who stay so late in the country.</p>
				<p>However, you will be able, I hope, to procure for me, between this and her return, some eclaircissements that may be useful to her; for these odious stories are founded on circumstances attendant on the death of <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont, of which you will probably have been informed, if there be any truth in them; or you can at least readily receive information, which I particularly request you to do⁠—This is what is published, or at least whispered as yet, but will not certainly fail to blaze out more.</p>
				<p>It is said the quarrel between <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont and Chevalier Danceny, is the work of Madame de Merteuil, who deceived them both; and, as it always happens, the rivals began by fighting, and did not come to an eclaircissement until after, which produced a sincere reconciliation: and in order to make <abbr>M.</abbr> de Merteuil known to Chevalier Danceny, and also in his own justification, <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont had added to his intelligence, a heap of letters, forming a regular correspondence which he had kept up with her; in which she relates, in the loosest manner, the most scandalous anecdotes of herself.</p>
				<p>It is added, that Danceny in his first rage gave those letters to whoever had a mind to see them; and that now they are all over Paris⁠—Two of them in particular, are quoted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a>; in one of which, she gives a full history of her life and principles, which are said to be the most shocking imaginable⁠—the other contains an entire justification of <abbr>M.</abbr> de Prevan, whose story you may recollect, by the proofs it gives, that he did nothing but acquiesce in the most pointed advances <abbr>M.</abbr> de Merteuil made him, and the rendezvous agreed on with her.</p>
				<p>But I have fortunately the strongest reasons to believe those imputations as false as they are odious. First, we both know that <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont was not engaged about Madame de Merteuil; and I have all the reason in the world to think, Danceny was as far from thinking of her: so that I think it is demonstrable, that she could not be either the cause or object of the quarrel. Neither can I comprehend what interest <abbr>M.</abbr> de Merteuil could have, who is supposed to be combined with <abbr>M.</abbr> de Prevan, to act a part which must be very disagreeable, by the noise it would occasion, and might be very dangerous for her, because she would thereby make an irreconcileable enemy of a man who was in possession of a part of her secrets, and who had then many partizans.⁠—Still it is observable, since that adventure, not a single voice has been raised in favour of Prevan, and that even there has not been the least objection made on his side since.</p>
				<p>Those reflections would induce me to suspect him to be the author of the reports that are now spread abroad, and to look on those enormities as the work of the revenge and hatred of a man who, finding himself lost in the opinion of the world, hopes, by such means, at least to raise doubts, and perhaps make a useful diversion in his favour; but whatever cause they may proceed from, the best way will be to destroy such abominable tales as soon as possible; they would have dropped of themselves, if it should happen, as is very probable, that <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont and Danceny did not speak to each other after their unhappy affair, and that there had been no papers given.</p>
				<p>Being impatient to be satisfied as to the truth of those facts, I sent this morning to M, Danceny’s; he is not in Paris either; his servants told my valet de chambre, he had set out last night, on some advice he had received yesterday, and the place of his residence was a secret; probably he dreads the consequence of his affair; it is only from you then, my dear and worthy friend, I can learn such interesting particulars, that may be necessary for <abbr>M.</abbr> de Merteuil⁠—I renew my request, and beg you will send them to me as soon as possible.</p>
