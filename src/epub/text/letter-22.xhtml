				<p epub:type="title">The Presidente de Tourvel to Madame de Volanges</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>You will, I doubt not, Madam, be desirous to be informed of an incident in the life of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> de Valmont, which seems to me to form a striking contrast to all those that have been related to you. Nothing can be more painful than to think disadvantageously of anyone, or so grievous as to find those who have every qualification to inspire the love of virtue, replete with vice; besides, you are so inclined to the exercise of the virtue of indulgence, that I think I can’t please you more, than in furnishing you motives for reconsidering any judgment you may have formed, that may be justly accused of rigour. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Valmont now seems entitled to this favour, I may almost say to this act of justice, for the following reason:</p>
			<p>This morning he went on one of those excursions, which might have given room to imagine a scheme in the neighbourhood; a supposition which, I must own, I too hastily adopted.</p>
			<p>Happily for him, and still more happily for us, since it preserves us from an act of injustice, one of my people had occasion to go the same way;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> and thus my fortunate, but censurable curiosity was satisfied. He acquainted us that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> de Valmont, having found at the village of ⸻, an unhappy family whose effects were on the point of being sold for payment of taxes, not only discharged the debt for the poor people, but even gave them a pretty considerable sum besides. My servant was witness to this virtuous act; and informs me that the country people, in conversation, told him, that a servant, whom they described, and who mine believes to belong to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> de Valmont, had been yesterday at the village to make inquiry after objects of charity. This was not a transitory fit of compassion; it must have proceeded from determined benevolence, the noblest virtue of the noblest minds; but be it chance or design, you must allow, it is a worthy and laudable act; the bare recital of it melted me to tears! I will add also still farther, to do him justice, that when I mentioned this transaction, of which he had not given the least hint, he begin by denying it to be founded; and even when he acquiesced, seemed to lay so little stress on it, that his modesty redoubled its merit. Now tell me, most venerable friend, if <abbr>M.</abbr> de Valmont is an irretrievable debauchee? If he is so, and behaves thus, where are we to look for men of principle? Is it possible that the wicked should participate with the good the extatic pleasures of benevolence? Would the Almighty permit that a virtuous poor family should receive aid from the hand of an abandoned wretch, and return thanks for it to his Divine Providence? And is it possible to imagine the Creator would think himself honoured in hearing pure hearts pouring blessings on a reprobate? No; I am rather inclined to think that errors, although they may have been of some duration, are not eternal; and I cannot bring myself to think, that the man who acts well, is an enemy to virtue. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> de Valmont is only, perhaps, another example of the dangerous effects of connections. I embrace this idea, and it gratifies me. If, on the one hand, it clears up his character in your mind, it will, on the other, enhance the value of the tender friendship that unites me to you for life.</p>

We take him with us, and shall give those good people the pleasure of again seeing their benefactor; which, I fancy, is all he has left us to do.</p>
